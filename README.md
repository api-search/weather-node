## APIs.io Weather
This is an APIs.io search node dedicated to weather. This where we will be publishing all of the weather APIs that we profile as part of our work.

All of this is still under construction, but will be stabilizing very soon. The only place you will find unique about this repository is in the _apis folder where we have all of the APIs.json for the APIs being profiled, the rest is just the website wrapper for the search engine.

If you have any questions submit an issue and we will do our best to answer, or feel fre to submit a PR adding any APIs to this index, and fork the index and run it locally. We will be publishing documentation to make this easier soon.
