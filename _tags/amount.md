                  integration with Apple Pay which uses Adyen's Apple Pay
                  certificate.


                  The endpoint returns the Apple Pay session data which you need
                  to complete the [Apple Pay session
                  validation](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/api-only?tab=adyen-certificate-validation_1#complete-apple-pay-session-validation).

                  and returns a unique reference for this request. You get the

                  [**TECHNICAL_CANCEL**
                  webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/cancel#cancellation-webhook).


                  If you want to cancel a payment using the
                  [`pspReference`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments__resParam_pspReference),
                  use the
                  [`/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels)
                  endpoint instead.


                  If you want to cancel a payment but are not sure whether it
                  has been captured, use the
                  [`/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals)
                  endpoint instead.

                  If you include [your supported

                  in the request, the response also tells you if you support
                  each [brand that was
                  identified](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/cardDetails__resParam_details).


                  If you have an API-only integration and collect card data, use
                  this endpoint to find out if the shopper's card is co-branded.
                  For co-branded cards, you must let the shopper choose the
                  brand to pay with  if you support both brands.

                  > If you're still using origin key for your Web Drop-in or

                  This allows you to use a single key for all origins, add or
                  remove origins without generating a new key, and detect the
                  card type from the number entered in your payment form.

                  The response depends on the [payment

                  * For a direct flow, the response includes a `pspReference`
                  and a `resultCode` with the payment result, for example
                  **Authorised** or **Refused**. 

                  * For a redirect or additional action, the response contains
                  an `action` object.

                  You can capture either the full authorised amount or a part of
                  the authorised amount. By default, any unclaimed amount after
                  a partial capture gets cancelled. This does not apply if you
                  enabled multiple partial captures on your account and the
                  payment method supports multiple partial captures. 


                  [Automatic
                  capture](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/capture#automatic-capture)
                  is the default setting for most payment methods. In these
                  cases, you don't need to make capture requests. However,
                  making capture requests for payments that are captured
                  automatically does not result in double charges.

                  Captures the authorisation hold on a payment, returning a
                  unique reference for this request. Usually the full
                  authorisation amount is captured, however it's also possible
                  to capture a smaller amount, which results in cancelling the
                  remaining authorisation balance.


                  Payment methods that are captured automatically after
                  authorisation don't need to be captured. However, submitting a
                  capture request on these transactions will not result in
                  double charges. If immediate or delayed auto-capture is
                  enabled, calling the capture method is not neccessary.

                  refunds.

                  A margin above the captured limit can be configured to cover
