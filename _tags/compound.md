                summary: Gets the latest relative rollover date for the database.
                description: >
                  Gets zero relative date and last update time for FactSet
                  databases. The dates represent the date that the rollover
                  event happened; the date and time is in **eastern time
                  zone**.  <p>Depending on the ids requested and their
                  respective regions, a requested startDate or endDate used in
                  the various Prices API may reflect different previous close
                  dates. This relative "zero" date, meaning - as of yesterday's
                  close - will vary across global regions. This API is designed
                  to help production systems account for regional rollover dates
                  to know when to trigger their processes for different regions
                  to reflect the latest close. The response gives context for
                  AMERICAS, ASIA PACIFIC, and EUROPE. </p>
