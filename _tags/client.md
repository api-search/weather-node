                  Sends sample notifications to test if the webhook is set up
                  correctly.


                  We send sample notifications for maximum 20 of the merchant
                  accounts that the webhook is configured for. If the webhook is
                  configured for more than 20 merchant accounts, use the
                  `merchantIds` array to specify a subset of the merchant
                  accounts for which to send test notifications.


                  We send four test notifications for each event code you
                  choose. They cover success and failure scenarios for the
                  hard-coded currencies EUR and GBP, regardless of the
                  currencies configured in the merchant accounts. For custom
                  notifications, we only send the specified custom notification.


                  The response describes the result of the test. The `status`
                  field tells you if the test was successful or not. You can use
                  the other response fields to troubleshoot unsuccessful tests.

                  Sends a request to activate the merchant account identified in
                  the path.


                  You get the result of the activation asynchronously through a
                  [`merchant.updated`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/ManagementNotification/latest/post/merchant.updated)
                  webhook. Once the merchant account is activated, you can start
                  using it to accept payments and payouts.


                  Use this endpoint if your integration requires it, such as
                  Adyen for Platforms Manage. Your Adyen contact will set up
                  your access.

                  verifies the bank account before allowing and enabling the
                  payout setting.


                  If you're accepting payments in multiple currencies, you may
                  add multiple payout settings for the merchant account.

                  Sends sample notifications to test if the webhook is set up
                  correctly.


                  We send four test notifications for each event code you
                  choose. They cover success and failure scenarios for the
                  hard-coded currencies EUR and GBP, regardless of the
                  currencies configured in the merchant accounts. For custom
                  notifications, we only send the specified custom notification.


                  The response describes the result of the test. The `status`
                  field tells you if the test was successful or not. You can use
                  the other fields to troubleshoot unsuccessful tests.

                  by specifying the action and the terminals that the action
                  must be applied to. 


                  The following restrictions apply:

                  * You can schedule only one action at a time. For example, to
                  install a new app version and remove an old app version, you
                  have to make two API requests. 

                  * The maximum number of terminals in a request is **100**. For
                  example, to apply an action to 250 terminals, you have to
                  divide the terminals over three API requests. 

                  * If there is an error with one or more terminal IDs in the
                  request, the action is scheduled for none of the terminals.
                  You need to fix the error and try again.

      <p>IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync,
      and ML inference capabilities to edge devices. This enables devices to
      collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react
      autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on
      local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with Amazon
      Web Services IoT Core and export IoT data to the Amazon Web Services
      Cloud. IoT Greengrass developers can use Lambda functions and components
      to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local
      operation.</p> <p>IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of
      the IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new console. Use this
      API reference to learn how to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to
      manage components, manage deployments, and core devices.</p> <p>For more

                  <p>Retrieves a list of components that meet the component,
                  version, and platform requirements of a deployment. Greengrass
                  core devices call this operation when they receive a
                  deployment to identify the components to install.</p> <p>This
                  operation identifies components that meet all dependency
                  requirements for a deployment. If the requirements conflict,
                  then this operation returns an error and the deployment fails.
                  For example, this occurs if component <code>A</code> requires
                  version <code>&gt;2.0.0</code> and component <code>B</code>
                  requires version <code>&lt;2.0.0</code> of a component
                  dependency.</p> <p>When you specify the component candidates
                  to resolve, IoT Greengrass compares each component's digest
                  from the core device with the component's digest in the Amazon
                  Web Services Cloud. If the digests don't match, then IoT
                  Greengrass specifies to use the version from the Amazon Web
                  Services Cloud.</p> <important> <p>To use this operation, you
                  must use the data plane API endpoint and authenticate with an
                  IoT device certificate. For more information, see <a

      <p>IAM Identity Center OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables
      a client (such as CLI or a native application) to register with IAM
      Identity Center. The service also enables the client to fetch the user’s
      access token upon successful authentication and authorization with IAM
      Identity Center.</p> <note> <p>IAM Identity Center uses the
      <code>sso</code> and <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces.</p>
      </note> <p> <b>Considerations for Using This Guide</b> </p> <p>Before you
      begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the following
      important information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service
      works.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently
      implements only the portions of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant
      standard (<a
      href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>)
      that are necessary to enable single sign-on authentication with the CLI.
      </p> </li> <li> <p>With older versions of the CLI, the service only emits
      OIDC access tokens, so to obtain a new token, users must explicitly
      re-authenticate. To access the OIDC flow that supports token refresh and
      doesn’t require re-authentication, update to the latest CLI version
      (1.27.10 for CLI V1 and 2.9.0 for CLI V2) with support for OIDC token
      refresh and configurable IAM Identity Center session durations. For more
      information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/configure-user-session.html">Configure
      Amazon Web Services access portal session duration </a>. </p> </li> <li>
      <p>The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all Amazon
      Web Services account entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user,
      not just a particular application.</p> </li> <li> <p>The documentation in
      this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert the access token
      into Amazon Web Services Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use with
      IAM-protected Amazon Web Services service endpoints. For more information,
      see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html">GetRoleCredentials</a>
      in the <i>IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference Guide</i>.</p> </li>
      </ul> <p>For general information about IAM Identity Center, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What
      is IAM Identity Center?</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center User
      Guide</i>.</p>

                   You provide the server with the public part of the key pair that you are going to use to create the value of the signature header for all future API calls. The server creates an installation for you. Store the Installation Token and ServerPublicKey from the response. This token is used in the "X-Bunq-Client-Authentication" header for the creation of a DeviceServer and SessionServer.

                description: >
                  The "Bulk" workflow allows the user to create a People
                  Concordance Task. Uploading of a Comma-Separated List file
                  (.csv / UTF-8 encoding) with a list of names and attributes
                  and creation of a task id is mandatory to start the process.
                     The taskId is then used for reference in the /people-task-status and /people-decisions endpoints to receive results once the task is successful.The /people-task-status endpoint is to check the status of the Tasks as per the ids.
                      A universeId must be included in request. If you do not have a universe created, reference the /universe endpoint.The bulk workflow supports a two way approach for the user.
                    **The user can use these parameters in the following ways.**
                      1.Filling all the required fields including the `personNameColumn`.(do not include `firstNameColumn`,`lastNameColumn` & `middleNameColumn`)
                      2.Filling all the required fields excluding the `personNameColumn`.(Ensure atleast the `lastNameColumn` is filled)
