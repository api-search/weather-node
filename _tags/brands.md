                  You need to use this endpoint if you have an API-only
                  integration with Apple Pay which uses Adyen's Apple Pay
                  certificate.


                  The endpoint returns the Apple Pay session data which you need
                  to complete the [Apple Pay session
                  validation](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/api-only?tab=adyen-certificate-validation_1#complete-apple-pay-session-validation).

                  and returns a unique reference for this request. You get the
                  outcome of the request asynchronously, in a
                  [**TECHNICAL_CANCEL**
                  webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/cancel#cancellation-webhook).


                  If you want to cancel a payment using the
                  [`pspReference`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments__resParam_pspReference),
                  use the
                  [`/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/cancels)
                  endpoint instead.


                  If you want to cancel a payment but are not sure whether it
                  has been captured, use the
                  [`/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/payments/{paymentPspReference}/reversals)
                  endpoint instead.

                  number to get a response with an array of brands on the card.
                  If you include [your supported
                  brands](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/cardDetails__reqParam_supportedBrands)
                  in the request, the response also tells you if you support
                  each [brand that was
                  identified](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/latest/post/cardDetails__resParam_details).


                  If you have an API-only integration and collect card data, use
                  this endpoint to find out if the shopper's card is co-branded.
                  For co-branded cards, you must let the shopper choose the
                  brand to pay with  if you support both brands.

                  > If you're still using origin key for your Web Drop-in or
                  Components integration, we recommend [switching to client
                  key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/client-side-authentication/migrate-from-origin-key-to-client-key).
                  This allows you to use a single key for all origins, add or
                  remove origins without generating a new key, and detect the
                  card type from the number entered in your payment form.

                  The response depends on the [payment

                  * For a direct flow, the response includes a `pspReference`
                  and a `resultCode` with the payment result, for example
                  **Authorised** or **Refused**. 

                  * For a redirect or additional action, the response contains
                  an `action` object.

                  You can capture either the full authorised amount or a part of
                  the authorised amount. By default, any unclaimed amount after
                  a partial capture gets cancelled. This does not apply if you
                  enabled multiple partial captures on your account and the
                  payment method supports multiple partial captures. 


                  [Automatic
                  capture](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/capture#automatic-capture)
                  is the default setting for most payment methods. In these
                  cases, you don't need to make capture requests. However,
                  making capture requests for payments that are captured
                  automatically does not result in double charges.
