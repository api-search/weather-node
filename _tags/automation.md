                  <p> The BatchCreateTableRows API allows you to create one or
                  more rows at the end of a table in a workbook. The API allows
                  you to specify the values to set in some or all of the columns
                  in the new rows. </p> <p> If a column is not explicitly set in
                  a specific row, then the column level formula specified in the
                  table will be applied to the new row. If there is no column
                  level formula but the last row of the table has a formula,
                  then that formula will be copied down to the new row. If there
                  is no column level formula and no formula in the last row of
                  the table, then that column will be left blank for the new
                  rows. </p>

                  <p> The BatchUpsertTableRows API allows you to upsert one or
                  more rows in a table. The upsert operation takes a filter
                  expression as input and evaluates it to find matching rows on
                  the destination table. If matching rows are found, it will
                  update the cells in the matching rows to new values specified
                  in the request. If no matching rows are found, a new row is
                  added at the end of the table and the cells in that row are
                  set to the new values specified in the request. </p> <p> You
                  can specify the values to set in some or all of the columns in
                  the table for the matching or newly appended rows. If a column
                  is not explicitly specified for a particular row, then that
                  column will not be updated for that row. To clear out the data
                  in a specific cell, you need to set the value as an empty

      <p>Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security
      state in Amazon Web Services and helps you assess your Amazon Web Services
      environment against security industry standards and best practices.</p>
      <p>Security Hub collects security data across Amazon Web Services
      accounts, Amazon Web Services, and supported third-party products and
      helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority
      security issues.</p> <p>To help you manage the security state of your
      organization, Security Hub supports multiple security standards. These
      include the Amazon Web Services Foundational Security Best Practices
      (FSBP) standard developed by Amazon Web Services, and external compliance
      frameworks such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the Payment
      Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the National Institute
      of Standards and Technology (NIST). Each standard includes several
      security controls, each of which represents a security best practice.
      Security Hub runs checks against security controls and generates control
      findings to help you assess your compliance against security best
      practices.</p> <p>In addition to generating control findings, Security Hub
      also receives findings from other Amazon Web Services, such as Amazon
      GuardDuty and Amazon Inspector, and supported third-party products. This
      gives you a single pane of glass into a variety of security-related
      issues. You can also send Security Hub findings to other Amazon Web
      Services and supported third-party products.</p> <p>Security Hub offers
      automation features that help you triage and remediate security issues.
      For example, you can use automation rules to automatically update critical
      findings when a security check fails. You can also leverage the
      integration with Amazon EventBridge to trigger automatic responses to
      specific findings.</p> <p>This guide, the <i>Security Hub API
      Reference</i>, provides information about the Security Hub API. This
      includes supported resources, HTTP methods, parameters, and schemas. If
      you're new to Security Hub, you might find it helpful to also review the
      <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html">
      <i>Security Hub User Guide</i> </a>. The user guide explains key concepts
      and provides procedures that demonstrate how to use Security Hub features.
      It also provides information about topics such as integrating Security Hub
      with other Amazon Web Services.</p> <p>In addition to interacting with
      Security Hub by making calls to the Security Hub API, you can use a
      current version of an Amazon Web Services command line tool or SDK. Amazon
      Web Services provides tools and SDKs that consist of libraries and sample
      code for various languages and platforms, such as PowerShell, Java, Go,
      Python, C++, and .NET. These tools and SDKs provide convenient,
      programmatic access to Security Hub and other Amazon Web Services . They
      also handle tasks such as signing requests, managing errors, and retrying
      requests automatically. For information about installing and using the
      Amazon Web Services tools and SDKs, see <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/">Tools to Build on Amazon Web
      Services</a>.</p> <p>With the exception of operations that are related to
      central configuration, Security Hub API requests are executed only in the
      Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific
      Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any
      configuration or settings change that results from the operation is
      applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions,
      call the same API operation in each Region in which you want to apply the
      change. When you use central configuration, API requests for enabling
      Security Hub, standards, and controls are executed in the home Region and
      all linked Regions. For a list of central configuration operations, see
      the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/central-configuration-intro.html#central-configuration-concepts">Central
      configuration terms and concepts</a> section of the <i>Security Hub User
      Guide</i>.</p> <p>The following throttling limits apply to Security Hub
      API operations.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>BatchEnableStandards</code> -
      <code>RateLimit</code> of 1 request per second. <code>BurstLimit</code> of
      1 request per second.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>GetFindings</code> -

                  Organization accounts do not receive invitations.</p>
                  <p>Before you can use this action to invite a member, you must
                  first use the <code>CreateMembers</code> action to create the
                  member account in Security Hub.</p> <p>When the account owner
                  enables Security Hub and accepts the invitation to become a
                  member account, the administrator account can view the
                  findings generated from the member account.</p>
