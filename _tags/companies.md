                  Sends sample notifications to test if the webhook is set up
                  correctly.


                  We send sample notifications for maximum 20 of the merchant
                  accounts that the webhook is configured for. If the webhook is
                  configured for more than 20 merchant accounts, use the
                  `merchantIds` array to specify a subset of the merchant
                  accounts for which to send test notifications.


                  We send four test notifications for each event code you
                  choose. They cover success and failure scenarios for the
                  hard-coded currencies EUR and GBP, regardless of the
                  currencies configured in the merchant accounts. For custom
                  notifications, we only send the specified custom notification.


                  The response describes the result of the test. The `status`
                  field tells you if the test was successful or not. You can use
                  the other response fields to troubleshoot unsuccessful tests.

                  Sends a request to activate the merchant account identified in
                  the path.


                  You get the result of the activation asynchronously through a
                  [`merchant.updated`](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/ManagementNotification/latest/post/merchant.updated)
                  webhook. Once the merchant account is activated, you can start
                  using it to accept payments and payouts.


                  Use this endpoint if your integration requires it, such as
                  Adyen for Platforms Manage. Your Adyen contact will set up
                  your access.

                  account specified in the path. A payout setting links the

                  verifies the bank account before allowing and enabling the
                  payout setting.


                  If you're accepting payments in multiple currencies, you may
                  add multiple payout settings for the merchant account.

                   To remove one item, the array must include the remaining two items. Or to add one item, the array must include all four items.

                  Sends sample notifications to test if the webhook is set up
                  correctly.


                  We send four test notifications for each event code you
                  choose. They cover success and failure scenarios for the
                  hard-coded currencies EUR and GBP, regardless of the
                  currencies configured in the merchant accounts. For custom
                  notifications, we only send the specified custom notification.


                  The response describes the result of the test. The `status`
                  field tells you if the test was successful or not. You can use
                  the other fields to troubleshoot unsuccessful tests.

                  by specifying the action and the terminals that the action
                  must be applied to. 


                  The following restrictions apply:

                  * You can schedule only one action at a time. For example, to
                  install a new app version and remove an old app version, you
                  have to make two API requests. 

                  * The maximum number of terminals in a request is **100**. For
                  example, to apply an action to 250 terminals, you have to
                  divide the terminals over three API requests. 

                  * If there is an error with one or more terminal IDs in the
                  request, the action is scheduled for none of the terminals.
                  You need to fix the error and try again.

      <p>Amazon WorkLink is a cloud-based service that provides secure access to
      internal websites and web apps from iOS and Android phones. In a single
      step, your users, such as employees, can access internal websites as
      efficiently as they access any other public website. They enter a URL in
      their web browser, or choose a link to an internal website in an email.
      Amazon WorkLink authenticates the user's access and securely renders
      authorized internal web content in a secure rendering service in the AWS
      cloud. Amazon WorkLink doesn't download or store any internal web content
      on mobile devices.</p>

                  only contains events with the status AWAITING_REPLY or

                  that are not related to a monetary account (for example:

                  This is the only API call that does not require you to use the
                  "X-Bunq-Client-Authentication" and "X-Bunq-Client-Signature"
                  headers.
                   You provide the server with the public part of the key pair that you are going to use to create the value of the signature header for all future API calls. The server creates an installation for you. Store the Installation Token and ServerPublicKey from the response. This token is used in the "X-Bunq-Client-Authentication" header for the creation of a DeviceServer and SessionServer.

                  ETP classification is divided into three categories: Asset
                  Class, Geography, and Investment Strategy. Asset class is
                  determined based on the various asset types held by the fund,
                  A fund's geography can be classified by region (e.g.
                  Asia-Pac), specific geography (e.g. China) or economic
                  development (e.g. BRIC). An ETP's investment strategy is
                  classified in broad categories (e.g. Large Cap) and more
