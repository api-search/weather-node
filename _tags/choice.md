                  </br>Once a Raw Transcript is published, FactSet's editors
                  review the call to produce a Corrected Transcript. They listen
                  to the entire audio file again to confirm that all of the
                  terms and numbers are correctly transcribed. FactSet aims to
                  publish a Corrected Transcript within six times the length of
                  the event, measured from the beginning of the event. That
                  means for a typical one-hour call, FactSet will produce a
                  Corrected Transcript within approximately five hours of the
                  call's completion. Visit [OA
