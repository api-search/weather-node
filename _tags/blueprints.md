                  {
                    "results": [

                      { ... }
                    ],
                    "limit": 25,
                    "size": 25,
                    ...
                    "_links": {

                    }
                  }

                  ```


                  When additional results are available, returns `next` and
                  `prev` URLs to retrieve them in subsequent calls. The URLs
                  each contain a cursor that points to the appropriate set of
                  results. Use `limit` to specify the number of results returned
                  in each call.

                  Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

                  ```

                  The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the
                  `next` in the example response.

                  Moves a pagetree rooted at a page to the space's trash:


                  - If the content's type is `page` and its status is `current`,
                  it will be trashed including

                  all its descendants.

                  - For every other combination of content type and status, this
                  API is not supported.


                  This API accepts the pageTree delete request and returns a
                  task ID.

                  The delete process happens asynchronously.

                   Response example:
                   <pre><code>
                   {
                        "id" : "1180606",
                        "links" : {

                  API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v2/intro/).


                  Returns a map of the direct children of a piece of content. A
                  piece of content

                  has different types of child content, depending on its type.
                  These are

                  the default parent-child content type relationships:


                  - `page`: child content is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `blogpost`: child content is `comment`, `attachment`

                  - `attachment`: child content is `comment`

                  - `comment`: child content is `attachment`


                  Apps can override these default relationships. Apps can also
                  introduce

                  new content types that create new parent-child content
                  relationships.


                  Note, the map will always include all child content types that
                  are valid

                  for the content. However, if the content has no instances of a
                  child content

                  type, the map will contain an empty array for that child
                  content type.

                  Top-level pages are difficult to find in the UI

                  because they do not show up in the page tree display. To avoid
                  this, never use `before` or `after` positions

                  when the `targetId` is a top-level page.

                  attacks, which is necessary as this method accepts
                  multipart/form-data.


                  The media type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC
                  7578](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt).

                  Most client libraries have classes that make it easier to
                  implement

                  multipart posts, like the
                  [MultipartEntityBuilder](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/)

                  Java class provided by Apache HTTP Components.


                  Note, according to [RFC
                  7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4.5),

                  in the case where the form data is text,

                  the charset parameter for the "text/plain" Content-Type may be
                  used to

                  indicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case
                  of this

                  API endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
                  `type=text/plain`

                  and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to be
                  UTF-8.


                  Example: This curl command attaches a file ('example.txt') to
                  a piece of

                  content (id='123') with a comment and `minorEdits`=true. If
                  the 'example.txt'

                  file already exists, it will update it with a new version of
                  the attachment.

                summary: Update attachment data
                description: >-
                  Updates the binary data of an attachment, given the attachment
                  ID, and

                  optionally the comment and the minor edit field.


                  This method is essentially the same as [Create or update
                  attachments](#api-content-id-child-attachment-put),

                  except that it matches the attachment ID rather than the name.


                  Note, you must set a `X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck` header on
                  the request

                  for this method, otherwise it will be blocked. This protects
                  against XSRF

                  attacks, which is necessary as this method accepts
                  multipart/form-data.


                  The media type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC
                  7578](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt).

                  Most client libraries have classes that make it easier to
                  implement

                  multipart posts, like the
                  [MultipartEntityBuilder](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/)

                  Java class provided by Apache HTTP Components.


                  Note, according to [RFC
                  7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4.5),

                  in the case where the form data is text,

                  the charset parameter for the "text/plain" Content-Type may be
                  used to

                  indicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case
                  of this

                  API endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
                  `type=text/plain`

                  and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to be
                  UTF-8.


                  Example: This curl command updates an attachment (id='att456')
                  that is attached

                  to a piece of content (id='123') with a comment and
                  `minorEdits`=true.


                  ``` bash

                  curl -D- \
                    -u admin:admin \
                    -X POST \
                    -H 'X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck' \
                    -F 'file=@"example.txt"' \
                    -F 'minorEdit="true"' \
                    -F 'comment="Example attachment comment"; type=text/plain; charset=utf-8' \

                  child pages.

                  - `attachment`: descendant is `comment`

                  - `comment`: descendant is `attachment`


                  The map will always include all descendant types that are
                  valid for the content.

                  However, if the content has no instances of a descendant type,
                  the map will

                  contain an empty array for that descendant type.

                summary: Get macro body by macro ID
                description: >-
                  Returns the body of a macro in storage format, for the given
                  macro ID.

                  This includes information like the name of the macro, the body
                  of the macro,

                  and any macro parameters. This method is mainly used by Cloud
                  apps.


                  About the macro ID: When a macro is created in a new version
                  of content,

                  Confluence will generate a random ID for it, unless an ID is
                  specified

                  (by an app). The macro ID will look similar to this:
                  '50884bd9-0cb8-41d5-98be-f80943c14f96'.

                  The ID is then persisted as new versions of content are
                  created, and is

                  only modified by Confluence if there are conflicting IDs.


                  Note, to preserve backwards compatibility this resource will
                  also match on

                  the hash of the macro body, even if a macro ID is found. This
                  check will

                  eventually become redundant, as macro IDs are generated for
                  pages and

                  transparently propagate out to all instances.

                  Removes a label from a piece of content. Labels can't be
                  deleted from archived content.

                  This is similar to [Remove label from content using query
                  parameter](#api-content-id-label-delete)

                  except that the label name is specified via a path parameter.


                  Use this method if the label name does not have "/"
                  characters, as the path

                  parameter does not accept "/" characters for security reasons.
                  Otherwise,

                  use [Remove label from content using query
                  parameter](#api-content-id-label-delete).

                description: >-
                  Copy page hierarchy allows the copying of an entire hierarchy
                  of pages and their associated properties, permissions and
                  attachments.
                   The id path parameter refers to the content id of the page to copy, and the new parent of this copied page is defined using the destinationPageId in the request body.
                   The titleOptions object defines the rules of renaming page titles during the copy;
                   for example, search and replace can be used in conjunction to rewrite the copied page titles.

                   Response example:
                   <pre><code>
                   {
                        "id" : "1180606",
                        "links" : {
                             "status" : "/rest/api/longtask/1180606"
                        }
                   }
                   </code></pre>
                   Use the /longtask/<taskId> REST API to get the copy task status.

                   is defined using the `destination` in the request body and can be one of the following types.

                    - `space`: page will be copied to the specified space as a root page on the space
                    - `parent_page`: page will be copied as a child of the specified parent page
                    - `existing_page`: page will be copied and replace the specified page

                  Updates restrictions for a piece of content. For each
                  operation specified in the request, it removes

                  any existing restrictions on the content for that operation,
                  and replaces them with the restrictions in the request.

                  Note: Not specifying an operation will ignore restrictions of
                  that type, and passing an empty list for an operation

                  will remove all existing restrictions of that type.

                  For example, if a page with `id=123` has a `read` restriction
                  for the `admins` group,

                  the following request will return `true`:

                  Note that a response of `true` does not guarantee that the
                  group can view the page, as it does not account for

                  account-inherited restrictions, space permissions, or even

                  Returns whether the specified content restriction applies to a
                  group.

                  For example, if a page with `id=123` has a `read` restriction
                  for the `123456` group id,

                  the following request will return `true`:

                  Note that a response of `true` does not guarantee that the
                  group can view the page, as it does not account for

                  account-inherited restrictions, space permissions, or even

                  Note, 'ignore' is an example custom relationship type.

                  'favourite' relationship is supported by default, but you can

                  For example, the following method creates a 'sibling'
                  relationship between

                  two pieces of content:

                  For example, the following method finds all users that have a
                  'collaborator'

                  relationship to a piece of content with an ID of '1234':

                  `GET
                  /wiki/rest/api/relation/collaborator/to/content/1234/from/user`

                  Note, 'collaborator' is an example custom relationship type.

                  (CQL)](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/).


                  **Note that CQL input queries submitted through the
                  `/wiki/rest/api/search` endpoint no longer support
                  user-specific fields like `user`, `user.fullname`,
                  `user.accountid`, and `user.userkey`.** 

                  See this [deprecation
                  notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/deprecation-notice-search-api/)
                  for more details.


                  Example initial call:

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25

                  ```


                  Example response:

                  ```

                  {
                    "results": [
                      { ... },
                      { ... },
                      ...
                      { ... }
                    ],
                    "limit": 25,
                    "size": 25,
                    ...
                    "_links": {
                      "base": "<url>",
                      "context": "<url>",
                      "next": "/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg",
                      "self": "<url>"
                    }
                  }

                  ```


                  When additional results are available, returns `next` and
                  `prev` URLs to retrieve them in subsequent calls. The URLs
                  each contain a cursor that points to the appropriate set of
                  results. Use `limit` to specify the number of results returned
                  in each call.


                  Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

                  ```

                  /wiki/rest/api/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

                  ```

                  The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the
                  `next` in the example response.

                  The look and feel settings for a space can be inherited from
                  the global

                  look and feel settings or provided by a theme.

                  -   For security reasons, permissions cannot be updated via
                  the API and

                  must be changed via the user interface instead.

                  -   Currently you cannot set space labels when updating a

                  Deletes a space. Note, the space will be deleted in a long
                  running task.

                  Therefore, the space may not be deleted yet when this method
                  has

                  returned. Clients should poll the status link that is returned
                  in the

                  response until the task completes.

                  Updates a space property. Note, you cannot update the key of a
                  space

                  property, only the value.

                  Creates a new space property. This is the same as `POST

                  /wiki/rest/api/space/{spaceKey}/property` but the key for the
                  property is passed as a

                  path parameter, rather than in the request body.

                  depending on the

                  type of template:


                  - If the template is a content template, it is deleted.

                  - If the template is a modified space-level blueprint
                  template, it reverts

                  to the template inherited from the global-level blueprint
                  template.

                  - If the template is a modified global-level blueprint
                  template, it reverts

                  to the default global-level blueprint template.

                   Note, unmodified blueprint templates cannot be deleted.

                body: >-
                  This is the reference for the Confluence Cloud REST API. This
                  API is the primary way to get and

                  modify data in Confluence Cloud, whether you are developing an
                  app or any other integration.

                  Use it to interact with Confluence entities, like pages and
                  blog posts, spaces, users, groups,

                  and more.
              - title: Authentication and authorization
                anchor: auth
                body: >-
                  **Authentication:** If you are building a Cloud app,
                  authentication is implemented via JWT or OAuth 2.0, depending
                  on what you are building (see [Security
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)).
                  Otherwise, if you are authenticating directly against the REST
                  API, the REST API supports basic auth (see [Basic auth for
                  REST
                  APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)).


                  **Authorization:** If you are building a Cloud app,
                  authorization can be implemented by
                  [scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/scopes/)
                  or by [OAuth 2.0 user
                  impersonation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-jwt-bearer-tokens-for-apps).
                  Otherwise, if you are making calls directly against the REST
                  API, authorization is based on the user used in the
                  authentication process.


                  See [Security
                  overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)
                  for more details on authentication and authorization.
              - title: Status codes
                anchor: status-code
                body: >-
                  The Confluence REST API uses the [standard HTTP status
                  codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


                  Responses that return an error status code will also return a
                  response body, similar to the following:

                  ```json

                  {
                    "statusCode": 404,
                    "data": {
                      "authorized": false,
                      "valid": false,
                      "errors": [
                        {
                          "message": {
                            "translation": "This is an example error message.",
                            "args": []
                          }
                        }
                      ],
                      "successful": false
                    },
                    "message": "This is an example error message."
                  }

                  ```
              - title: Using the REST API
                anchor: using
                body: >-
                  **Expansion:** The Confluence REST API uses resource
                  expansion: some parts of a resource are not returned unless
                  explicitly specified. This simplifies responses and minimizes
                  network traffic.


                  To expand part of a resource in a request, use the `expand`
                  query parameter and specify the entities to be expanded. If
                  you need to expand nested entities, use the `.` dot notation.
                  For example, the following request will expand information
                  about the requested content's space and labels:

                  ```

                  GET /wiki/rest/api/content/{id}?expand=space,metadata.labels

                  ```

                  **Pagination:** The Confluence REST API uses pagination: a
                  method that returns a response with multiple objects can only
                  return a limited number at one time. This limits the size of
                  responses and conserves server resources.


                  Use the 'limit' and 'start' query parameters to specify
                  pagination:


                  - `limit` is the number of objects to return per page. This
                  may be restricted by system limits.

                  - `start` is the index of the first item returned in the page
                  of results. The base index is 0.


                  For example, the following request will return ten content
                  objects, starting from the fifth object.

                  ```

                  GET /wiki/rest/api/content?start=4&limit=10

                  ```

                  **Special headers:**


                  - `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` request header must be
                  specified for methods

                  that are protected from Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF)
                  attacks. This is

                  stated in the method description, if required. For more
                  information, see this

                  **Webhooks:** A webhook is a user-defined callback over HTTP.
                  You can use Confluence webhooks to notify your app or web
                  application when certain events occur in Confluence. For
                  example, when a page is created or updated. To learn more, see
                  [Webhooks](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/modules/webhook/).


                  **Content properties:** Content properties are a key-value
                  storage associated with a piece of Confluence content. If you
                  are building an app, this is one form of persistence that you
                  can use. You can use the Confluence REST API to get, update,
                  and delete content properties. To learn more, see [Content
                  properties in the REST
                  API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/content-properties/).


                  **CQL:** The Confluence Query Language (CQL) allows you to
                  perform complex searches for content using an SQL-like syntax
                  in the `search` resource. To learn more, see [Advanced
                  searching using
