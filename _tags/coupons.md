                description: >
                  Adds a new *Consignment* to *Checkout*.


                  Perform the following two steps to define the fulfillment of
                  the items in the cart.
                    ### For **shipping** consignments:
                      1. Add a new Consignment to Checkout.
                          * Send a `POST` request to `/consignments` with each shipping address, line item IDs, and quantities. Each address can have its own line item IDs.
                          * Provide a full valid customer address before placing the order. If provided, the order placement will succeed. 
                          * As part of the request URL make sure to add `include=consignments.availableShippingOptions` to return the available shipping options based on the items, the address, and the shipping location. This will return `availableShippingOptions` in the response.

                        * Required Fields:
                          * `shipping_address` (deprecated) or `address`
                          * `lineItems`
                      2. Update the Consignment with Shipping Options using the [REST Storefront API](/checkouts/checkout-consignments#update-a-consignment), the [REST Management API](/docs/rest-management/checkouts/checkout-consignments#update-checkout-consignment) or the [GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/guide/graphql-storefront).
                            
                    ### For **pickup** consignments:
                      1. Create a new consignment object. 
                        - Send a `POST` request to `/consignments` with line item IDs and quantities.
                        - Provide a `pickupMethodId`. This is the `id` of the Pickup Method provided in the response body of the Storefront Pickup Options API.
                        - Required Fields:
                            * `pickupOption`
                            * `lineItems`

                  > * Substitute your storefront domain for

                summary: Update a Consignment
                description: >-
                  Updates an existing consignment. An update is either one of
                  the following:


                  1. Updates the consignment address and/or line items.

                  2. Selects a specific fulfillment option.


                  ### Update the consignment address and line items

                  For this type of update, the payload is the same as when
                  creating a new consignment.         Update each *Consignment*
                  `shippingOptionId` (shipping address and line items) with the
                  `availableShippingOption > id` from the POST `/consignment`
                  response. 


                  **Note:**

                  Updating a consignment could invalidate the value for
                  `selectedShippingOption` and `selectedPickupOption`.


                  ### Select a specific fulfillment option

                  Before placing an order, each consignment must have a
                  `selectedShippingOption` or a `selectedPickupOption`.


                  If the consignment already has a pick-up option selected and a
                  shipping option is provided, the pick-up option will be
                  deselected and the shipping option will be selected instead
                  (and vice versa). The `PUT` request will fail if it contains a
                  shipping option ID and a pickup option ID.


                  Required Fields:

                  * `shippingOptionId` or `pickupOptionId`

                  * `lineItems`


                  To learn more about creating a Checkout Consignment see
                  [Checkout Consignment
                  API](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/guide/consignments).


                  > #### Notes

                  > * You cannot pass both an `address` and a `shippingOptionId`
                  because the shipping option may not be available for the new
                  address

                  This discount only applies to `line_items`. When you call this

                  items, including product and order-based discounts.


                  This endpoint splits the discount between line items based on
                  the item value.

                  Updates an existing consignment. The address, line item IDs,
                  and shipping option ID can be updated using this endpoint.


                  Use a separate `PUT` request to update the shipping option IDs
                  if you also want to update the address and line item IDs.  


                  To add new shipping options, complete the following steps: 

                  * Use the [Add Consignment to
                  Checkout](/docs/rest-management/checkouts/checkout-consignments#add-consignment-to-checkout)
                  endpoint to add a new [consignment] to a checkout. 

                  * Assign a shipping option to the new consignment by sending a
                  `PUT` request to update the consignment's `shipping_option_id`
                  with a returned value from
                  `data.consignments[N].available_shipping_option[N].id`
                  obtained in the [Add Consignment to
                  Checkout](/docs/rest-management/checkouts/checkout-consignments#add-consignment-to-checkout)
                  endpoint. 


                  To update an existing address and line item IDs, assign a new
                  address and line item IDs by sending a `PUT` request.


                  Please note that this API endpoint is not concurrent safe,

                  2. Assign a shipping option to the new consignment by sending
                  a `PUT` request to update the consignment's
                  `shipping_option_id` with a returned value from
                  `data.consignments[N].available_shipping_option[N].id`
                  obtained in Step One.

                  customer it is assigned to. Create a new redirect URL for the
                  customer so they can access the cart again.

                  ## Usage notes

                  * Orders created will be set to incomplete order status.

                  * You can create as many orders from the same order (cart) as
                  you want.

                  * Order duplication copies the existing order, assigns a new
                  order number, and sets the new order status to `incomplete`.

                  * Once the order is paid, the cart is deleted.

                  * Cart deletion occurs if you are using BigCommerce to accept
                  payments on orders.

                  **Usage Notes** * The response from performing this POST
                  request is a checkout token. * The checkout token is a
                  single-use token that is not order-dependent. You cannot
                  create this token after finalizing an order. * After
                  completing the order, you can redirect the shopper to
                  /order-confirmation/{orderId}?t={checkoutToken}. * After token
                  validation, the /order-confirmation/{orderId} page displays. *
                  The `ORDER_TOKEN` should match the order or the logged-in

                  coupon/discount id, from lowest to highest. You can pass in
                  optional filter parameters. We recommended using
                  `?min_id=x&limit=y` to paginate through a large set of data
                  because it offers better performance.


                  ## Usage Notes


                  Available types for `type` and `exclude_type` filters:


                  |Type|

                  |-|

                  |`per_total_discount`|

                  |`shipping_discount`|

                  |`free_shipping`|

                  |`promotion`|


                  Coupons with `type=promotion` will not populate usable data
                  for the following fields but instead be set to the following
                  default values:


                  ```json

                  ...

                  amount : 0.0000

                  *   `id`

                  *   `num_uses`


                  **Notes**


                  The coupon type can be one of the following:


                  *   `per_item_discount`

                  *   `per_total_discount`

                  *   `shipping_discount`

                  *   `free_shipping`

                  *   `percentage_discount`


                  Legacy coupon codes only work with the store's default
                  currency. Applying a coupon with any other currency other than
                  the store's default will result in the error: "Coupons only
                  apply to default currency."

                description: >-
                  Search for a notation whose ISIN, specified NSINs, name, or
                  symbol match the search value according to a tolerant
                  full-text match algorithm. If more than one notation of an
                  instrument matches, only the notation with the highest
                  monetary trading volume, averaged over one month, is
                  considered. Better matching results appear in the response
                  before less relevant matches. If the parameter popularity is
                  set to true, the popularity of the notation is the primary
                  sort criterion. Popularity is affected mostly by the request
                  frequency of the notation.

      A coupon contains information about a percent-off or amount-off discount
      you might want to apply to a customer. Coupons may be applied to
      subscriptions, invoices, checkout sessions, quotes, and more. Coupons do
      not work with conventional one-off charges or payment intents.

                  <p>You can create coupons easily via the <a
                  href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons">coupon
                  management</a> page of the Stripe dashboard. Coupon creation
                  is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons
                  on the fly.</p>


                  <p>A coupon has either a <code>percent_off</code> or an
                  <code>amount_off</code> and <code>currency</code>. If you set
                  an <code>amount_off</code>, that amount will be subtracted
                  from any invoice’s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a
                  subtotal of <currency>100</currency> will have a final total
                  of <currency>0</currency> if a coupon with an
                  <code>amount_off</code> of <amount>200</amount> is applied to
                  it and an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>300</currency>
                  will have a final total of <currency>100</currency> if a
                  coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of <amount>200</amount>
                  is applied to it.</p>
